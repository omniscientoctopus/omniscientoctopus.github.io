# About

I am a PhD candidate in the [AiDAPT Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/aidapt) at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), Netherlands. My research focuses on applying multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to inspection and maintenance planning of deteriorating engineering systems.

I obtained my masterâ€™s degree in Computational Sciences in Engineering (CSE) at [TU Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de), Germany in 2021. My focus was on structural mechanics, numerical methods for PDEs, and deep learning. In my master's thesis, I applied sensitivity analysis to vector-valued functions. Using this experience, I helped develop the sensitivity analysis module in the open-source [UQpy](https://github.com/SURGroup/UQpy) package.

**Research interests**: multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, uncertainty quantification, and physics-informed machine learning.
